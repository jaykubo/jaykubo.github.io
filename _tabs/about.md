## From ATX to TYO

Hi, I’m Jay.

I’m originally from the LA area and have lived in NYC (2010–2015) and the SF Bay Area (2015–2018) before heading to Austin in 2019. In late 2025, I made the move to Tokyo.

I’m a curious maker who enjoys turning ideas into friendly, functional experiences. I love thoughtful details, calm vibes, and creating work that makes people smile.
